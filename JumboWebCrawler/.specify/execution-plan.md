# Jumbo WebCrawler - Execution Plan

This document outlines the plan for executing the Jumbo WebCrawler project using the issues created in the `issues.md` file. The plan provides a structured approach to implementing the project in phases, with dependencies, milestones, and key considerations.

## Project Management Approach

### 1. Repository Setup

1. **Create Repositories**:
   - Create `jumbo-webcrawler-frontend` repository
   - Create `jumbo-webcrawler-backend` repository
   - Set up branch protection rules for main branches
   - Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)

2. **Issue Creation**:
   - Create all issues from the `issues.md` file in respective repositories
   - Label issues appropriately (priority, type, etc.)
   - Set milestones for each phase

3. **Project Board Setup**:
   - Create project boards for tracking progress
   - Configure columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
   - Add automation for issue transitions

### 2. Development Workflow

1. **Branch Strategy**:
   - `main` - Production-ready code
   - `develop` - Integration branch
   - Feature branches: `feature/issue-number-short-description`
   - Bug fixes: `fix/issue-number-short-description`

2. **Code Review Process**:
   - All code changes require pull requests
   - At least one reviewer approval required
   - CI checks must pass
   - Use pull request templates for consistency

3. **Release Strategy**:
   - Create tagged releases after completing each phase
   - Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Generate release notes from closed issues

## Phase Execution Plan

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - **Risk**: Integration issues between frontend and backend
     - **Mitigation**: Early and frequent integration testing, clear API contracts
   
   - **Risk**: Performance issues with large crawls
     - **Mitigation**: Performance testing with large datasets, implement pagination and streaming

   - **Risk**: Database limitations with SQLite
     - **Mitigation**: Benchmark early, consider sharding or alternative storage for specific use cases

2. **Schedule Risks**:
   - **Risk**: Scope creep extending timeline
     - **Mitigation**: Regular backlog grooming, strict change control process
   
   - **Risk**: Underestimation of complex features
     - **Mitigation**: Build in buffer time, break down tasks further

   - **Risk**: External dependencies causing delays
     - **Mitigation**: Identify critical dependencies early, create contingency plans

3. **Quality Risks**:
   - **Risk**: Insufficient test coverage
     - **Mitigation**: Define test coverage requirements, include testing in definition of done
   
   - **Risk**: User experience issues
     - **Mitigation**: Early user testing, usability reviews

   - **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities
     - **Mitigation**: Regular security scans, follow security best practices

## Communication Plan

### Regular Meetings

1. **Daily Standup** (15 minutes):
   - What was accomplished yesterday
   - What will be worked on today
   - Any blockers or issues

2. **Weekly Planning** (1 hour):
   - Review progress against milestones
   - Plan next week's tasks
   - Address any issues or risks

3. **Bi-weekly Demo** (30 minutes):
   - Demonstrate completed features
   - Gather feedback
   - Celebrate achievements

4. **Phase Review** (2 hours, end of each phase):
   - Review completed work
   - Evaluate against milestone criteria
   - Plan adjustments for next phase

### Documentation Updates

- Update README files with new setup instructions
- Maintain API documentation as endpoints evolve
- Document key decisions and architecture changes
- Keep issues and project board up to date

## Getting Started

To begin executing this plan:
