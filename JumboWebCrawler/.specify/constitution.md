# Jumbo WebCrawler - Project Constitution

This document establishes the foundational principles and standards that guide our development process for the Jumbo WebCrawler project. These principles serve as the constitution for our codebase, ensuring consistency, quality, and alignment with our project goals.

## 1. Code Quality Principles

### 1.1 Clean Code Standards
- **Readability First**: Code should be written for humans first, computers second
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables, functions, and classes must have clear, descriptive names
- **Function Size**: Functions should be small and focused on a single responsibility
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain "why" not "what" the code does
- **Dead Code**: Remove unused code instead of commenting it out

### 1.2 Architecture Standards
- **Modular Design**: Organize code into cohesive modules with clear boundaries
- **Dependency Management**: Follow dependency inversion principles
- **State Management**: Implement clear, predictable state management patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- **Configuration**: Externalize configuration from code

### 1.3 Code Style & Formatting
- **Consistent Style**: Follow the established TypeScript/JavaScript style guide
- **Automatic Formatting**: Use ESLint and Prettier for automatic code formatting
- **Code Reviews**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Static Analysis**: Maintain zero warnings from static analysis tools

## 2. Testing Standards

### 2.1 Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% test coverage for critical business logic
- **Edge Cases**: Test edge cases and error scenarios explicitly
- **Regression Testing**: Prevent regressions with comprehensive test suites

### 2.2 Testing Methodologies
- **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: For module interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: For critical user flows
- **Performance Tests**: For time-critical operations

### 2.3 Test Quality
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Follow the AAA pattern for test structure
- **Test Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other
- **Test Readability**: Tests should serve as documentation
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services

## 3. User Experience Consistency

### 3.1 Design System Adherence
- **Component Library**: Use shadcn/ui components consistently
- **Design Tokens**: Follow established color, typography, and spacing tokens
- **Responsive Design**: All interfaces must work on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### 3.2 Interaction Patterns
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- **Form Validation**: Immediate feedback for invalid inputs
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions between states

### 3.3 Performance Perception
- **Time to Interactive**: Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds
- **Feedback**: Immediate feedback for user actions
- **Animations**: Purposeful animations that guide user attention
- **Progress Indication**: Clear progress indicators for long-running tasks

## 4. Performance Requirements

### 4.1 Frontend Performance
- **Bundle Size**: Keep initial bundle under 250KB
- **Rendering Performance**: 60fps scrolling and animations
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement effective client-side caching

### 4.2 Backend Performance
- **Response Time**: API endpoints respond in under 200ms
- **Concurrency**: Handle at least 100 concurrent users
- **Memory Usage**: Stable memory usage during crawling
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries with execution plans

### 4.3 Crawler Performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect site's crawl limits
- **Parallel Processing**: Configurable concurrency
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor and limit CPU/memory consumption
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle slow or unresponsive sites

## 5. Security Standards

### 5.1 Input Validation
- **Sanitize Inputs**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- **URL Validation**: Strict URL validation before crawling
- **File Upload Validation**: Validate file types and sizes

### 5.2 Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: No storage of sensitive data from crawled sites
- **API Security**: Implement rate limiting and authentication
- **Dependency Security**: Regular audit of dependencies

## 6. Documentation Requirements

### 6.1 Code Documentation
- **JSDoc Comments**: Document all public APIs
- **README Files**: Each module must have a README
- **Architecture Documentation**: Document system architecture decisions

### 6.2 User Documentation
- **User Guide**: Comprehensive user documentation
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples for common scenarios

## 7. Development Process

### 7.1 Version Control
- **Branching Strategy**: Feature branches with pull requests
- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit format
- **PR Size**: Keep PRs focused and manageable in size

### 7.2 Continuous Integration
- **Automated Tests**: All tests must pass before merging
- **Code Quality Gates**: Maintain quality metrics above thresholds
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated deployment process
